about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hi, my name's Paolo and I'm young space engineer, mostly. I stand out in creativity and innovation, that's why I carry out tons of projects and ideas in my free time. Some of them are simply hoobies, others real business. My dream is to contribute to **scientific research** by bringing my know-how and expertise to **space missions** aimed at advancing humankind.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Matlab</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
# I am currently working on my MSc thesis while designing and producing dedicated nano-satellite hardware and software at Spacemind.
