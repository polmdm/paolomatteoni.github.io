  Hi, my name's Paolo and I'm young space engineer, mostly. I stand out in creativity and innovation, that's why I carry out tons of projects and ideas in my free time. Some of them are simply hoobies, others real business.

  I am currently working on my MSc thesis while designing and producing dedicated nano-satellite hardware and software at Spacemind.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Matlab</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The team’s challenge is to fit all the major subsystems of a satellite inside this minimal volume, launched by a small rocket up to an altitude of 1 km. As the CanSat descends, its mission begins.
